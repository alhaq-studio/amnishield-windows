---

## 📋 General Questions

### What is AmnShield?
AmnShield is a **privacy-first Islamic content filtering system** for Windows that helps Muslims and Muslim families maintain digital purity by blocking harmful content across browsers and applications. It combines a desktop guardian app with browser extensions to provide comprehensive protection.

### Who is AmnShield for?
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Muslim families** seeking to protect children from inappropriate content
- 🧔 **Individuals** struggling with online temptations
- 🏫 **Islamic schools and madrasahs** needing institutional protection
- 🕌 **Mosques** providing computer access to community members
- 🤲 **Anyone** committed to lowering their gaze online

### Is AmnShield free?
**Yes!** AmnShield v0.1.0 is completely **free for personal use**. We believe digital purity should be accessible to all Muslims.

**Future plans:**
- Personal/family use: Always free (Insha'Allah)
- Schools/organizations: Paid licenses (to sustain development)
- Optional donations welcome (Sadaqah Jariyah)

### Is the source code open source?
**Not currently.** The source code is **proprietary** to prevent bad actors from:
- Creating bypass tools
- Removing protection features
- Distributing modified malicious versions

**However:**
- Security researchers can request audit access (NDA required)
- We may open-source parts in the future
- Transparency through independent security audits

### Does AmnShield collect my data?
**Absolutely NOT.** AmnShield has **zero data collection**:
- ❌ No browsing history
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No telemetry or analytics
- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No communication with external servers

**Everything happens locally on your device.** See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details.

### How can I verify AmnShield's privacy claims?
1. **Network Monitoring:** Use Wireshark or Fiddler to inspect traffic (you'll see only `localhost:47147` communication)
2. **File System Audit:** All data stored in `%APPDATA%\AmnShield\` (local only)
3. **Security Audit:** Request source code access for review (email: security@alhaqdigital.com)

⚠️ **Important:** If you forget your password in v0.1.0, you'll need to reinstall. Password recovery coming in v0.2.

### Can AmnShield be bypassed?
**Honest answer:** Yes, with enough technical skill and admin privileges.

**What AmnShield protects against:**
- ✅ Accidental access to inappropriate sites

### What if I relapse despite using AmnShield?
**Remember:**
- 🤲 **Allah is Most Merciful:** Repent sincerely (Tawbah)
- 🔄 **Keep trying:** Failing doesn't mean you're a failure
- 💪 **Seek help:** Speak to an imam, counselor, or trusted friend
- 📚 **Learn:** Understand triggers and develop coping strategies
- 🤝 **Support groups:** Join Muslim accountability communities

**AmnShield is a shield, not a cage.** It helps, but ultimate success requires:
- Sincere intention (Niyyah)
- Trust in Allah (Tawakkul)
- Consistent effort (Istiqamah)

> *"Indeed, Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves."* (Quran 13:11)
